## Packages

In this part you will work with the **tidyverse** package, which is a collection of packages for doing data analysis in a "tidy" way.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data

We will use the `midwest` data frame once again for this homework.
The data contains demographic characteristics of counties in the Midwest region of the United States.
Because the data set is part of the **ggplot2** package, you can read documentation for the data set, including variable definitions by typing `?midwest` in the Console or searching for `midwest` in the Help pane.

## Questions

### Question 1

Calculate the number of counties in each state and display your results in descending order of number of counties. 

Which state has the highest number of counties, and how many? 

Which state has the lowest number, and how many?

::: render-commit-push
Render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message "Added answer for Question 1".

Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.
:::

### Question 2

While two counties in a given state can’t have the same name, some county names might be shared across states. A classmate says 

> “Look at that, there is a county called `___` in each state in this dataset!” 

In a single pipeline, discover all counties that could fill in the blanks. Your response should be a data frame with only the county names that could fill in the blank and the number of times they appear in the data, and narrative stating the county names that could fill in this blank. 

::: callout-tip
You will want to use the `filter()` function in your answer, which requires a logical condition to describe what you want to filter for.
For example, `filter(x > 2)` means filter for values of `x` greater than 2, and `filter(y <= 3)` means filter for values of y less than or equal to 3.

The table below is a summary of logical operators and how to articulate them in R.

| operator      | definition                |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| `<`           | less than                 |
| `<=`          | less than or equal to     |
| `>`           | greater than              |
| `>=`          | greater than or equal to  |
| `==`          | exactly equal to          |
| `!=`          | not equal to              |
| `x & y`       | `x` AND `y`               |
| `x` \| `y`    | `x` OR `y`                |
| `is.na(x)`    | test if `x` is `NA`       |
| `!is.na(x)`   | test if `x` is not `NA`   |
| `x %in% y`    | test if `x` is in `y`     |
| `!(x %in% y)` | test if `x` is not in `y` |
| `!x`          | not `x`                   |

::: render-commit-push
Render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message "Added answer for Question 2".

Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.
:::

### Question 3

Return to the following box plot of population densities where you were asked to identify at least one outlier.

```{r}
#| label: popdensity-boxplot
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 3
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
ggplot(midwest, aes(x = popdensity)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Population densities of midwest counties",
    x = "Population density"
  )
```

In this question, we want you to revisit this box plot and identify the counties described in each section.

a. The counties with a population density higher than 25,000. Your code must use the `filter()` function.

b. The county with the highest population density. Your code must use the `max()` function.

Answer using a single data wrangling pipeline for each part. Your response should be a data frame with five columns: county name, state name, population density, total population, and area, in this order. If your response has multiple rows, the data frame should be arranged in descending order of population density.

::: render-commit-push
Render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message "Added answer for Question 3".

Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.
:::

### Question 4

In HW 1 you were also asked to describe the distribution of population densities.
The following is one acceptable description that touches on the shape, center, and spread of this distribution.
Calculate the values that should go into the blanks.

> The distribution of population density of counties is unimodal and extremely right-skewed. A typical Midwestern county has population density of `____` people per unit area. The middle 50% of the counties have population densities between `____` to `____` people per unit area.

::: callout-tip
Think about which measures of center and spread are appropriate for skewed distributions.
:::

::: render-commit-push
Now is another good time to render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an informative and concise commit message.

Once again, make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards.
:::

### Question 5

Another visualization from HW 1 was the following, which showed the proportion of urban (located in metropolitan area) counties in each state.

```{r}
#| label: metro-barplot
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-height: 3
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
midwest <- midwest |>
  mutate(metro = if_else(inmetro == 1, "Yes", "No"))

ggplot(midwest, aes(x = state, fill = metro)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(
    title = "Do some states have more urban counties than others?",
    x = "State",
    y = "Proportion in metro area",
    fill = "In metro area?"
  )
```

Calculate these proportions in a single data pipeline.

::: callout-tip
Remember, you'll first need to create a new variable called `metro` which takes on the value `Yes` if the value of `inmetro` is 1, and `No` otherwise.
You can refer to [HW 1](/hw/hw-1.html#question-5) if you need a refresher on how to do this.
:::

::: render-commit-push
Now is another good time to render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an informative and concise commit message.

And once again, make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.
We keep repeating this because it's important and because we see students forget to do this.
So take a moment to make sure you're following along with the version control instructions.
:::

# Part 2 -- Feedback from Humans

Your answers to the questions in this part should go in the file `hw-2-part-2.qmd`.

## Packages

You will use the **tidyverse** package for data wrangling and visualization, **scales** for better axis labels, and **ggbeeswarm** for additional geoms.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(ggbeeswarm)
```

## Data

For the remaining questions on the homework, you will continue use data on counties in North Carolina that you used in HW 1.

As a reminder, the dataset contains information on North Carolina counties retrieved from the 2020 Census as well as from [myFutureNC Dashboard](https://dashboard.myfuturenc.org/county-data-and-resources/) maintained by Carolina Demography at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

This dataset is stored in a file called `nc-county.csv` in the `data` folder of your project/repository.

The variables in the dataset and their descriptions are the same as in HW 1:

-   `county`: Name of county.
-   `land_area_m2`: Land area of county in meters-squared, based on the 2020 census.
-   `land_area_mi2`: Land area of county in miles-squared, based on the 2020 census.
-   `pop_2020`: Population of county, based on the 2020 Census.
-   `pop_dens_2020`: Population density calculated as population (`pop_2020`) divided by land area in miles-squared (people per mile-squared).
-   `county_type`: Peer county type classification based on population characteristics, socioeconomic status, and geographic features used for grouping counties with similar demographic, social, and economic characteristics, allowing them to be compared and benchmarked against one another.
-   `median_hh_income`: Median household income.
-   `p_foreign_born`: Percentage of population that is foreign-born.
-   `p_child_poverty`: Percentage of children living in poverty.
-   `p_single_parent_hh`: Percentage of households with children that are single-parent households.
-   `p_broadband`: Percentage of households with broadband internet access.
-   `p_home_ownership`: Percentage of homes that are owner-occupied.
-   `p_family_sustaining_wage`: Percentage of adults that earn a family-sustaining wage -- typically a wage that covers essential costs like housing, food, childcare, transportation, and healthcare for a family's basic needs within a specific geographic area
-   `p_edu_lths`: Percentage of 25-44-year-olds with less than a high school diploma.
-   `p_edu_hsged`: Percentage of 25-44-year-olds with a high school diploma or equivalent.
-   `p_edu_scnd`: Percentage of 25-44-year-olds with some college or an associate degree.
-   `p_edu_ndc`: Percentage of 25-44-year-olds with non-degree credentials -- certifications, licenses, or other credentials that demonstrate specific skills or knowledge but do not confer a formal academic degree.
-   `p_edu_assoc`: Percentage of 25-44-year-olds with an associate degree.
-   `p_edu_ba`: Percentage of 25-44-year-olds with a bachelor's degree.
-   `p_edu_mapl`: Percentage of 25-44-year-olds with a master's, professional, or doctoral degree.
-   `p_edu_hs_grad_rate`: High school graduation rate.
-   `p_edu_chronic_absent_rate`: Chronic absenteeism rate.

You can read this file into R with the following code:

```{r}
nc_county <- read_csv("data/nc-county.csv")
```

## Questions

### Question 6

a.  Report the number of rows and columns in `nc_county`.

b.  Create a new variable called `p_edu_he` (short for "percentage of population with higher education") that is the sum of the percentages of 

    - 25-44-year-olds with some college or an associate degree (`p_edu_scnd`), 
    - non-degree credentials (`p_edu_ndc`), 
    - an associate degree (`p_edu_assoc`), 
    - a bachelor's degree (`p_edu_ba`), and
    - a master's, professional, or doctoral degree (`p_edu_mapl`).

    and store this variable in the `nc_county` data frame.

    Then, report the number of rows and columns in `nc_county` after adding this variable.

::: callout-warning
If you don't create the new variable `p_edu_he` in part (b), you will not be able to answer the remaining parts of this question or any of the remaining questions on the homework.

Therefore, here is a quick check to make sure you created the variable correctly -- after creating the variable, run the following code:

```{r}
#| eval: false
nc_county |> 
  select(p_edu_he) |> 
  slice_head(n = 3)
```

You should see the following output:

```
# A tibble: 3 × 1
  p_edu_he
     <dbl>
1    0.615
2    0.525
3    0.525
```

If you do not see this output, please revisit part (b) of this question and make sure you created the variable correctly. 
Ask for help on Ed or in office hours if you need assistance.

:::

c.  In a single pipeline, calculate the 

    - minimum,
    - first quartile (25th percentile),
    - median (50th percentile),
    - mean,
    - third quartile (75th percentile), and
    - maximum

    of `p_edu_he`.

d.  In a single pipeline, calculate the same statistics as in the previous part, but for each `county_type`.

::: render-commit-push
Render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message "Added answer for Question 6".

Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.
:::

### Question 7

Using the variable you created in Question 6, re-create the following plot that shows the distribution of `p_edu_he` by `county_type`.

![](images/hw-2/plot-to-recreate.png)

::: callout-tip
- x-axis: You learned how to format the x-axis as percentages in class and had a hint about it in your previous homework assignment. You can use the same approach here.

- Points: The points are drawn with the `geom_beeswarm()` function from the **ggbeeswarm** package.

- Outliers: The outliers in the box plots are drawn as _open circles_. You can specify this with the `outlier.shape` argument in `geom_boxplot()`. You can also adjust the size of the outliers with the `outlier.size` argument. The ggplot2 [aesthetic specifications documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html#point) has a list of shape names you can use for help.

- Color palette: The colors for the box plots are manually specified in a `scale_color_manual()` layer. You do not need to worry about the exact colors, but you should try to get close, e.g., use blue-ish colors for Rural counties, red-ish for Suburban, and brown-ish for Urban. You can use HEX codes for colors or look up named colors in R in the [R colors cheatsheet](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2020-04/colorPaletteCheatsheet.pdf)

- Transparency: You should adjust the transparency of the box plots. You don't have to worry about the exact transparency value, but you should try to get close.

- Theme: This plot uses a non-default theme. See [theme options documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html) for options.

- Aspect ratio and width: You can adjust the aspect ratio and width of your plot in your _rendered document_ by setting `fig-asp` and `fig-width` options in the code cell.
:::

::: render-commit-push
Render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message "Added answer for Question 7".

Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.
:::

### Question 8

In a single pipeline, identify the outliers in the plot in the previous question, and return a data frame with the county name, county type, percentage with higher education. This data frame should be arranged in ascending order of county type and descending order of percentage with higher education.

::: render-commit-push
Render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message "Added answer for Question 8".

Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterward.
:::

### Question 9

Create a scatter plot with percentage of 25-44 year olds with higher education (`p_edu_he`) on the x-axis and median household income (`median_hh_income`) on the y-axis. Describe the relationship between these two variables. In your description, make sure to comment on the direction, form, strength, and any unusual observations. For unusual observations, identify the counties that correspond to these observations, and make sure to include the code you used to identify them as part of your answer. Your code should output the county name, percentage with higher education, and median household income for each unusual observation.

Requirements for the plot (in addition to the requirements in the overall assignment guidelines:

- The x-axis should be formatted as percentages, e.g., 30%, not 0.3.
- The y-axis should be formatted as dollar amounts, e.g., \$40,000, not 4e+04.

::: render-commit-push
Render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an informative and concise commit message.
:::

### Question 10

Come up with a **new** question (one that has not already been asked in this homework) that you could answer with the `nc_county` data frame and the new `p_edu_he` variable you created in Question 6 and state it explicitly.
Then, answer your question with an appropriate data visualization and/or data transformation pipeline and a brief description of your findings. Note: the visualization or data transformation must be different from anything already done within this homework.
