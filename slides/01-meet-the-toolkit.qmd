## Setup

- Load package we need for the analyis:

```{r}
#| label: load-tidyverse
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
```

- Load the data:

```{r}
#| label: load-survey-data-display
#| eval: false
survey <- read_csv("data/survey-anonymized.csv")
```

```{r}
#| label: load-survey-data-hide
#| include: false
survey <- read_csv(here::here("slides", "data/survey-anonymized.csv"))
```

## Revisit: Cleaning up programming languages with AI {.xsmall}

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
library(ellmer)

chat <- chat_openai()

prompts <- survey |>
  filter(!is.na(programming_languages)) |>
  pull(programming_languages) |>
  list()

type_language <- type_object(
  language = type_string(),
  experience = type_string()
)

language_experience <- parallel_chat_structured(chat, prompts, type = type_language)
language_experience
```

```         
language
1 Python, Java, R, C/C++, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, C#, VBA, MATLAB, Rust, Assembly, Swift, Stata, Bash, Typescript, Web3 Suite (HTML, CSS, JS), Nextflow, SAS, PsycoPy, Mathematica, React, Vue, Yaml, CourseKata, Flutter, Scratch

experience
1 Most students report a range of programming experience, from never having programmed before to being very comfortable in languages such as Python, Java, and R. Many took introductory courses (e.g., CS101, AP CS A) and are comfortable with basic programming constructs. Proficiency is generally highest in Python and Java, though some only have a little experience with languages like R, C/C++, and JavaScript. Quite a few have only used programming languages for specific classes or research projects and may not feel confident after a long break. Some students have experience with more niche or specialized tools such as MATLAB, SAS, and web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/JS frameworks). Many express a need for a refresher if not used recently. In summary, while a core group is comfortable with at least one language, especially Python or Java, many others have only basic to moderate experience and express the desire to gain more proficiency.
```

## Can it be trusted 100%? {.xxxsmall}

**Nextflow** -- didn't show up before due to case mismatch (Netxflow vs. nextflow)

```{r}
survey |>
  mutate(programming_languages = str_to_lower(programming_languages)) |>
  filter(str_detect(programming_languages, "nextflow"))  |>
  select(programming_languages)
```

**PsychoPy** -- misspelled by AI (PsycoPy vs. PsychoPy) + case mismatch

```{r}
survey |>
  mutate(programming_languages = str_to_lower(programming_languages)) |>
  filter(str_detect(programming_languages, "psychopy"))  |>
  select(programming_languages)
```

**CourseKata** -- not a programming language but a learning platform

```{r}
survey |>
  mutate(programming_languages = str_to_lower(programming_languages)) |>
  filter(str_detect(programming_languages, "coursekata"))  |>
  select(programming_languages)
```

# From last time: Course overview + policies

## Tips for success

-   Prepare: Watch videos and read before class
-   Engage: Attend all lectures and labs actively
-   Ask questions: Use office hours and Ed Discussion forum
-   Start early: Don’t procrastinate on assignments
-   Stay current: Content builds progressively

## Support

-   Help from humans:
    -   Attend office hours
    -   Ask and answer questions on the discussion forum
-   Help from AI: Use the course chatbot (in Canvas!)
-   Reserve email for questions on personal matters and/or grades
-   Read the course support page

## Announcements

-   Posted on Canvas (Announcements tool) and sent via email, be sure to check both regularly
-   I'll assume that you've read an announcement by the next "business" day
-   I'll (try my best to) send a weekly update announcement each Friday, outlining the plan for the following week and reminding you what you need to do to prepare, practice, and perform

## Diversity, inclusion, and belonging {.smaller}

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.

::: incremental

-   Fill out the Getting to know you survey.
-   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your advisors, and deans are excellent resources.
-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.

:::

## Access and accommodations {.smaller}

-   The [Duke Access and Accommodation Services](https://access.duke.edu) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments.

-   Accoomodations for exams must be arranged through Access and Accommodation Services and exams with accommodations must be taken in the testing center.

-   I am committed to making all course materials accessible and I'm always learning how to do this better.
    If any course component is not accessible to you in any way, please don't hesitate to let me know.

## Late work, waivers, lecture recordings, regrades...

-   We have policies!
-   Read about them on the [course syllabus](https://sta199-f25.github.io/course-syllabus.html) and refer back to them when you need it

## Participate 💻📱 {.smaller}

{{< include _wooclap-slide.qmd >}}

## Use of AI tools {.smaller}

-   {{< fa check >}} **AI tools for code:**

    -   Check your work after you've done it yourself, to polish and improve, not to do it for you from scratch.
    -   Be careful/critical! Working code `!=` correct/good code.
    -   **Must explicitly cite**, with at a minimum AI tool you're using (e.g., ChatGPT) and your prompt. More guidance to be provided with assignments.

-   {{< fa ban >}} **AI tools for narrative:** Absolutely not!

-   {{< fa check >}} **AI tools for learning:** Sure, but be careful/critical!

## Academic integrity

> To uphold the Duke Community Standard:
>
> -   I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
>
> -   I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
>
> -   I will act if the Standard is compromised.

## A note on showing up and participating {.smaller}

-   This is a large "lecture" but with lots of opportunities and expectations for active learning, participation, and collaboration.

-   You are expected to show up and participate in all lectures and labs, though there are a good number of each you can miss without penalty.

-   It's possible to read the books and watch the videos and get an exposure to the material we cover in the course without showing up, but the experience will be much less rich and you will likely miss out on a lot of learning.
    That's why the assessments and workflows are designed to reward and reinforce active participation.

# Toolkit: Computing

## Learning goals {.smaller}

By the end of the course, you will be able to...

::: incremental

-   gain insight from data
-   gain insight from data, **reproducibly**
-   gain insight from data, reproducibly, **using modern programming tools and techniques**
-   gain insight from data, reproducibly **and collaboratively**, using modern programming tools and techniques
-   gain insight from data, reproducibly **(with literate programming and version control)** and collaboratively, using modern programming tools and techniques

# Reproducible data analysis

## Reproducibility checklist {.smaller}

::: question

What does it mean for a data analysis to be "reproducible"?

:::

. . .

**Short-term goals:**

-   Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
-   Does the code actually do what you think it does?
-   In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done?

. . .

**Long-term goals:**

-   Can the code be used for other data?
-   Can you extend the code to do other things?

## Toolkit for reproducibility

::: incremental

-   Scriptability -- Coding as opposed to using a point-and-click tool $\rightarrow$ R
-   Literate programming -- Code, narrative, output in one place, as opposed to copying and pasting code output into a document (e.g., Word or Google Doc) that contains the narrative $\rightarrow$ Quarto
-   Version control -- Track changes with brief messages that describe those changes $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub

# R and RStudio

## R and RStudio {.smaller}

::::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](images/01/r-logo.png){fig-alt="R logo" fig-align="center"}

-   R is an open-source statistical **programming language**
-   R is also an environment for statistical computing and graphics
-   It's easily extensible with *packages*

:::

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}

![](images/01/rstudio-logo.png){fig-alt="RStudio logo"}

-   RStudio is a convenient interface for R called an **IDE** (integrated development environment), e.g. *"I write R code in the RStudio IDE"*
-   RStudio is not a requirement for programming with R, but it's very commonly used by R programmers and data scientists

## Tour recap: R + RStudio

![](images/01/tour-r-rstudio.png)

# A short list<br>(for now)<br>of R essentials

## Packages {.smaller}

-   Installed with `install.packages()`, once per system:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

::: callout-note

We already pre-installed many of the package you'll need for this course, so you might go the whole semester without needing to run `install.packages()`!

:::

. . .

-   Loaded with `library()`, once per session:

```{r}
#| label: load-palmerpenguins
library(palmerpenguins)
```

## Packages, an analogy

If data analysis was cooking...

::: incremental

-   Installing a package would be like buying ingredients from the store

-   Loading a package would be like getting the ingredients out of your pantry and setting them on your counter top to be used

:::

::: {.column .fragment width="60%"}

[tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/)

-   The **tidyverse** is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science
-   All packages share an underlying philosophy and a common grammar

:::

:::

## Data frames and variables

-   Each row of a data frame is an **observation**

. . .

-   Each column of a data frame is a **variable**

. . .

-   Columns (variables) in data frames can be accessed with `$`:

```{r}
#| eval: false
dataframe$variable_name
```

## `penguins` data frame {.smaller}

```{r}
penguins
```

:::

## `flipper_length_mm` {.smaller}

This can be fixed by using `penguins$flipper_length_mm`.

```{r}
penguins$flipper_length_mm
```

## `function(argument)`

Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:

```{r}
#| eval: false
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

## `trim`med `mean()`

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 100)
x
```

```{r}
mean(x)
```

```{r}
mean(x, trim = 0.05)

## Git and GitHub tips {.smaller}

::: incremental

-   There are millions of git commands -- ok, that's an exaggeration, but there are a lot of them -- and very few people know them all. 99% of the time you will use git to add, commit, push, and pull.
-   We will be doing Git things and interfacing with GitHub through RStudio, but if you google for help you might come across methods for doing these things in the command line -- skip that and move on to the next resource unless you feel comfortable trying it out.
-   There is a great resource for working with git and R: [happygitwithr.com](http://happygitwithr.com/). Some of the content in there is beyond the scope of this course, but it's a good place to look for help.
