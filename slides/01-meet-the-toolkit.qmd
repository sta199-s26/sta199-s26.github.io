# Preliminaries

## Reminders

::: incremental
- Complete Lab 0 ASAP;
- Don't forget the `Getting to know you` survey;
- Accept your GitHub invitation pronto;
- Submit your SDAO letters and make testing center appointments now;
- Start lurking on Ed. Questions are being answered!
:::

## Updates

::: incremental
- There will be ~~eight~~ seven homeworks. HW 1 appears next week;
- Office hours are posted and begin today.

## Last time {.medium}

Spring break splits the class into two parts:

::: incremental
- Data science:
  - convert data into knowledge;
  - take a spreadsheet and compress it into pictures and a concise set of numerical summaries;
  - try to teach a reader about the world or convince them of a claim;
- Statistical thinking:
  - quantify our uncertainty about the results produced above;
  - use this to make tricky decisions.
:::

## The data science life cycle {.medium}

You will learn how to use a computer to actually *do* the following:

. . .

![](images/00/data-science-cycle-cropped.png){fig-align="center"}

. . .

We emphasize *technique* (how do you make literally anything happen), but we also want you to develop *good taste* so that you can do these things well and convincingly.

## Managing expectations

- Today is the first time all 300+ of us are attempting to access our containers simultaneously;
- I have yet to see this work the first time;
- After we get over the hump: smooth sailing;
- Until then: blood bath;
- Raise your hand if you need anything;
- If today is not your day, just sit back and watch.

## Today and for forever {.large}

Please ask questions!

- Ask JZ: general interest questions about the presentation;
- Ask TA: technical questions about your particular computer.

# Toolkit: Computing

## Learning goals {.smaller}

By the end of the course, you will be able to...

::: incremental

-   gain insight from data
-   gain insight from data, **reproducibly**
-   gain insight from data, reproducibly, **using modern programming tools and techniques**
-   gain insight from data, reproducibly **and collaboratively**, using modern programming tools and techniques
-   gain insight from data, reproducibly **(with literate programming and version control)** and collaboratively, using modern programming tools and techniques

:::

## Two important concepts {.smaller}

. . .

Computational *reproducibility*:

::: incremental
- If you give me your code and your data and I hit "Run," do I get the same numbers and the same pictures that you published in your article? 
- If so...phew!
- If not...what the 🤬?
:::

. . .

Scientific *replication*:

. . .

- Can new researchers conduct an independent analysis and reach the same substantive conclusions that you did?
- Just because your analysis is computationally reproducible does not mean that you have a robust result that generalizes.

. . .

Our tools will help you achieve the first, which is necessary (but not sufficient!) for the second.

## Reproducibility checklist {.smaller}

::: question

What does it mean for a data analysis to be "reproducible"?

:::

. . .

**Short-term goals:**

-   Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
-   Does the code actually do what you think it does?
-   In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done?

. . .

**Long-term goals:**

-   Can the code be used for other data?
-   Can you extend the code to do other things?

## Toolkit for reproducibility

::: incremental

-   Scriptability -- Coding instead of point-and-click $\rightarrow$ R
-   Literate programming -- code, written text, results all in one place instead of error-prone copy-paste $\rightarrow$ Quarto
-   Version control -- Track changes with brief messages that describe those changes $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub

:::

## Collaboration

::: incremental
- Collaboration doesn't just mean working with others. It also means collaborating with yourself *across time*;
- Too often, I have set something aside only to return to it several weeks (or even days!) later and ask "who did this and what were they thinking?"
- Our tools will make you an excellent collaborator with others, but they will also help you keep yourself organized.

![](images/01/r-logo.png){fig-alt="R logo" fig-align="center"}

-   R is an open-source statistical **programming language**
-   R is also an environment for statistical computing and graphics
-   It's easily extensible with *packages*

## R packages {.smaller}

::: incremental

-   **Packages**: Fundamental units of reproducible R code, including reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data<sup>1</sup>

-   As of 27 August 2025, there are 22,578 R packages available on **CRAN** (the Comprehensive R Archive Network)<sup>2</sup>

-   We're going to work with a small (but important) subset of these!

## Tour recap: R + RStudio

![](images/01/tour-r-rstudio.png)

# A short list<br>(for now)<br>of R essentials

## Packages {.smaller}

-   Installed with `install.packages()`, once per system:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

::: callout-note

We already pre-installed many of the package you'll need for this course, so you might go the whole semester without needing to run `install.packages()`!

:::

. . .

-   Loaded with `library()`, once per session:

```{r}
#| label: load-palmerpenguins
library(palmerpenguins)
```


## Data frames and variables

-   Each row of a data frame is an **observation**

. . .

-   Each column of a data frame is a **variable**

. . .

-   Columns (variables) in data frames can be accessed with `$`:

```{r}
#| eval: false
dataframe$variable_name
```

## `penguins` data frame {.smaller}

```{r}
penguins
```

## `bill_length_mm`  {.smaller}

```{r}
penguins$bill_length_mm
```

## Why did the error occur?




```{r}
#| label: flipper-length-mm
#| error: true
flipper_length_mm
```


## `flipper_length_mm` {.smaller}

This can be fixed by using `penguins$flipper_length_mm`.

```{r}
penguins$flipper_length_mm
```

## `function(argument)`

Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:

```{r}
#| eval: false
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

## `mean()`

Let's compute the average of a set of numbers:

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
x
```

. . .

```{r}
mean(x)
```

## `mean()`

```{r}
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm)
```

. . .

Wut?

. . .

```{r}
head(penguins$flipper_length_mm)
```

. . .

There's a *missing value* (`NA` stands for "not available").

. . .


```{r}
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Help

Object documentation can be accessed with `?`

## Summary of R essentials {.smaller}

-   Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:

```{r}
#| eval: false

do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

<br>

-   Packages are installed with the `install.packages()` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:

```{r}
#| eval: false

install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```

Your containers come "fully loaded," so you may not have to install any new packages.

## Summary of R essentials (continued) {.smaller}

Data frames: like the spreadsheets of R

-   Each row of a data frame is an **observation**
-   Each column of a data frame is a **variable**

![](images/01/df.png)

## Summary of R essentials (continued) {.smaller}

-   Use the question mark `?` to get help with objects (like data frames and functions):

```{r}
#| eval: false

?function_name

```

-   Use the dollar sign `$` to access columns

```{r}
#| eval: false

dataframe$column

```

::: callout-note
Generally, you need to use the `$` to tell R *where* to find that column.
:::

## Summary of R essentials (continued) {.smaller}

-   Use the arrow `<-` or equals sign `=` to save objects

```{r}
#| eval: false

x = some_thing
y <- some_other_thing

```

::: callout-note
Check your environment pane for the saved object!
:::

## Summary of R essentials (continued) {.smaller}

-   Read your error messages!

<br>

-   These are essential for figuring out where your code is going wrong.

<br><br>

::: callout-note
If you have trouble understanding what a message is saying, there is a high chance someone has explained the message online.
:::



## Packages, an analogy

If data analysis was cooking...

::: incremental

-   Installing a package would be like buying ingredients from the store

-   Loading a package would be like getting the ingredients out of your pantry and setting them on your counter top to be used

:::

## tidyverse

::: hand

aka the package you'll hear about the most...

:::

::: columns

::: {.column width="40%"}

:::

::: {.column .fragment width="60%"}

[tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/)

-   The **tidyverse** is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science
-   All packages share an underlying philosophy and a common grammar

# Toolkit: Version control and collaboration

## Git and GitHub {.smaller}

::: columns

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}

![](images/01/git-logo.png){fig-alt="Git logo" fig-align="center" width="150"}

-   Git is a version control system -- like "Track Changes" features from Microsoft Word, on steroids
-   It's not the only version control system, but it's a very popular one

:::

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}

![](images/01/github-logo.png){fig-alt="GitHub logo" fig-align="center" width="150"}

-   GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet -- like DropBox but much, much better

-   We will use GitHub as a platform for web hosting and collaboration (and as our course management system!)

## Git and GitHub tips {.smaller}

::: incremental

-   There are millions of git commands -- ok, that's an exaggeration, but there are a lot of them -- and very few people know them all. 99% of the time you will use git to add, commit, push, and pull.
-   We will be doing Git things and interfacing with GitHub through RStudio, but if you google for help you might come across methods for doing these things in the command line -- skip that and move on to the next resource unless you feel comfortable trying it out.
-   There is a great resource for working with git and R: [happygitwithr.com](http://happygitwithr.com/). Some of the content in there is beyond the scope of this course, but it's a good place to look for help.

<details>
<summary>Tour recap: Git + GitHub</summary>

-   Find your application repo, that will always be named using the naming convention `assignment_title-YOUR-GITHUB-NAME`, e.g., `ae-johnczito` or `lab-1-johnczito`.

-   Click on the green "Code" button, make sure SSH is selected, copy the repo URL

![](images/01/tour-git-github-1.png){fig-align="center" width="600"}

-   In RStudio, File \> New Project \> From Version Control \> Git

-   Paste repo URL copied in previous step, then click tab to auto-fill the project name, then click Create Project

-   **If you haven't done Lab 0**, **for one time only**, type `yes` in the pop-up dialogue

</details>

## What could have gone wrong?

- Never received GitHub invite $\rightarrow$ Fill out "Getting to know you survey

- Never accepted GitHub invite $\rightarrow$ Look for it in your email and accept it

- Cloning repo fails $\rightarrow$ Review/redo Lab 0 steps for setting up SSH key

- Still no luck? Stay after class today or come by my office hours tomorrow or post on Ed for help

# Quarto

## Quarto

::: incremental

-   Fully reproducible reports -- each time you render the analysis is run from the beginning;
-   Code goes in cells (between the three back ticks);
-   Written English goes outside cells, the same way you would write in Google Docs or MS Word.

<summary>Tour recap: Git + GitHub</summary>

Once we made changes to our Quarto document, we

- went to the Git pane in RStudio

- staged our changes by clicking the checkboxes next to the relevant files

- committed our changes with an informative commit message

- pulled from GitHub to make sure we had the latest version of our repo

- pushed our changes to our application exercise repos

- confirmed on GitHub that we could see our changes pushed from RStudio

</details>

## How will we use Quarto?

-   Every application exercise, lab, project, etc. is an Quarto document
-   You'll always have a template Quarto document to start with
-   The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester
