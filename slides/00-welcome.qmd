**Office hours begin Monday January 12.**

## What are we studying?

First half:

::: callout-note
## Data science

- Transforming messy, incomplete, imperfect data into *knowledge*;
- *Knowledge* often takes the form of pictures and a concise set of numerical summaries.
:::

. . .

Second half:

::: callout-warning
## Statistical thinking

Quantifying our uncertainty about that knowledge.
:::

## Imagine this dialog {.small}

. . .

[**Campaign manager**]{style="color:blue;"}: What is the probability that our candidate wins the election?

. . .

(A flurry of analysis takes place.)

. . .

[**Data scientist**]{style="color:red;"}: Our best guess is 54%.

. . .

[**Campaign manager**]{style="color:blue;"}: How reliable is that estimate? How confident are we in that? What's the margin of error?


. . .

::: columns

**Parallel Universe 1**

[**Data scientist**]{style="color:red;"}: It's 54% give or take 3%.

:::  {.fragment}

**Parallel Universe 2**

[**Data scientist**]{style="color:red;"}: It's 54% give or take 20%.

:::

. . .

::: callout-note
## It's all about decision-making under uncertainty

The manager is going to make wildly different decisions about campaign strategy and spending depending on how uncertain the environment is.

-   Communication: Ed Discussion
-   Assignment submission and feedback: Gradescope

## Activities {.smaller}

-   Introduce new content and prepare for lectures by watching the videos and completing the readings
-   Attend and actively participate in lectures (and answer questions for participation credit) and labs, office hours, team meetings
-   Practice applying statistical concepts and computing with application exercises during lecture
-   Put together what you've learned to analyze real-world data
    -   Lab assignments
    -   Homework assignments
    -   Exams
    -   Term project completed in teams
    
## Grading {.smaller}

| Category              | Percentage |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Lectures (attendance + participation) | 5%         |
| Labs                  | 8%         |
| HW                    | 12%         |
| Project               | 15%        |
| Midterm 1                | 20%        |
| Midterm 2                | 20%        |
| Final                 | 20%        |

See course syllabus for how the final letter grade will be determined.

## Wiggle room

- After Drop/Add, you can miss 4 of 22 lectures and still receive full attendance credit;
- We drop the two lowest labs;
- We drop the lowest homework;
- We replace the lowest midterm score with your final exam score (if it’s better).

## Attendance and participation {.smaller}

-   Daily in lecture

-   Tracked for credit, but not based on correctness, only participation (and often they will be questions designed to make you think that might not have a single right answer!)

## Application exercises

-   Lecture meetings will typically involve me babbling for 45 - 60 minutes, and then we work through a guided activity where you try out the latest material for yourself;

-   Not graded, but tracked for feedback on workflow

## Labs {.smaller}

-   Hands-on practice with data analysis

-   A single exercise per lab, graded based on being there and turning in something reasonable + correctness

-   Completed in-person, in lab, in teams

-   Teams randomized each week until project teams assigned

-   Developed collaboratively, but turned in individually by the end of the lab session

-   8 throughout semester, two lowest scores dropped

-   No late work accepted

## Homework {.smaller}

-   Hands-on practice with data analysis

-   Some questions for practice with instant feedback by AI

-   Some questions to be graded by humans for correctness

-   Can start in lab if time permits, but completed at home

-   Can consult with course team and peers, but completed and turned in individually by the end of the week

-   7 throughout semester, lowest score dropped

-   Up to 3 days late (-5% per day), no late work accepted after that

-   One-time late penalty waiver: Can be used on any homework assignment, no questions asked, must be requested from Dr. Knox before the deadline

## Exams {.smaller}

-   Two midterm exams during semester, comprised of two parts:

    -   (80%) In-class: 75 minute in-class exam. Closed book, one sheet of notes;

    -   (20%) Take-home: Follow from the in class exam and focus on the analysis of a dataset introduced in the take home exam.

-   Final, in-class only: Closed book, one sheet of notes;

- Notes for exams: Both sides of a single 8.5" x 11" sheet **prepared by you and you alone**;

- No extensions or make-ups.

::: callout-caution
Exam dates cannot be changed and no make-up exams will be given. If you can’t take the exams on these dates, you should drop this class.
:::

::: callout-note
## If you need testing accomodations
Make sure I get a letter, and make your appointments in the Testing Center now.
:::

## Project {.smaller}

-   Dataset of your choice, method of your choice

-   Teamwork

-   Interim deadlines throughout semester

-   Final milestone: Presentation in lab and write-up

-   Must be in lab, in-person to present

-   Peer review between teams for content, peer evaluation within teams for contribution

-   Some lab sessions allocated to project progress

::: callout-caution
Project due date cannot be changed. You must complete the project to pass this class.
:::

## Teams {.smaller}

-   Randomized at first for weekly labs

-   Then selected by you or assigned by me if you don't express a preference for project and remaining labs

-   Expectations and roles
    -   Everyone is expected to contribute equal *effort*
    -   Everyone is expected to understand *all* code turned in
    -   Individual contribution evaluated by peer evaluation, commits, etc.

-   For the project: Peer evaluation during teamwork and after completion

# Wrap up

## Silly exercise, serious themes {.scrollable .medium}

::: incremental
-   **Domain knowledge and modeling assumptions**: data do not speak for themselves. You need some subject-matter expertise about what you're studying, as well as an interpretive lens;

    - Not all models or assumptions are created equal!

-   Are you asking questions the data can actually answer?
-   Uncertainty has many sources, and in some cases, it may be simply irreducible, no matter how hard you try;
-   **Data quality and data cleaning**: Data are not gospel. There could be noise and mistakes. Then what?
-   **Wisdom of crowds**: aggregating many imperfect guesses can do better than any one individual guess.
:::

## This week's tasks

-   Attend Lab 0 tomorrow (**very important!**):
    -   Computational setup;
    -   Getting to know you survey;
-   Read the syllabus and ask questions on Ed;
-   Complete readings and videos for next class;
-   Send me SDAO letters and schedule testing center appointments.
