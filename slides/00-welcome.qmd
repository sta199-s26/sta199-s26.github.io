# Syllabus highlights

## Homepage

[https://sta199-s26.github.io](https://sta199-s26.github.io/){.uri}

-   All course materials
-   Links to Canvas, GitHub, RStudio containers, etc.

## Course toolkit

All linked from the course website:

-   GitHub organization: [github.com/sta199-s26](https://github.com/sta199-s26)
-   RStudio containers: [cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers](https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers)
-   Communication: Ed Discussion
-   Assignment submission and feedback: Gradescope

## Activities {.smaller}

-   Introduce new content and prepare for lectures by watching the videos and completing the readings
-   Attend and actively participate in lectures and labs, office hours, team meetings
-   Practice applying statistical concepts and computing with application exercises during lecture, graded for attempting
-   Put together what you've learned to analyze real-world data
    -   Lab assignments (7 or 8 throughout semester)
    -   Exams (midterm x 2 + final)
    -   Term project completed in teams

## Application exercises

-   Daily-ish in lecture

-   "Graded" for attempt, not accuracy

-   Practice Weeks 1 + 2, graded thereafter

-   At least one commit by 2 pm of the day of lecture

-   Turn in at least 70% for full credit

## Labs

-   Start in lab session

-   Complete at home

-   Due within a week

-   Discussion with classmates ok, copying not ok!

-   Lowest score dropped

## Exams {.smaller}

-   Three exams, each 20%

-   Midterm comprised of two parts:

    -   In-class: 75 minute in-class exam. Closed book, one sheet of notes (“cheat sheet”) – 70% of the grade.

    -   Take-home: Follow from the in class exam and focus on the analysis of a dataset introduced in the take home exam – 30% of the grade.

-   Final in-class only (Apr 29, 9am - 12pm): Closed book, one sheet of notes (“cheat sheet”).

-   "Cheat sheet": No larger than 8.5" x 11", both sides, **must be prepared by you**.

::: callout-caution
Exam dates cannot be changed and no make-up exams will be given. If you can’t take the exams on these dates, you should drop this class.
:::

## Project {.smaller}

-   Dataset of your choice, method of your choice

-   Teamwork

-   Five milestones, interim deadline throughout semester

-   Final milestone: Presentation (video) and write-up

-   Presentations submitted as videos

-   Peer review between teams for content, peer evaluation within teams for contribution

-   Some lab sessions allocated to project progress

::: callout-caution
Project due date cannot be changed. You must complete the project to pass this class.
:::

## Teams of 4 - 5 {.smaller}

-   Assigned by us *within your lab section*
-   Project
-   Peer evaluation during teamwork and after completion
-   Expectations and roles
    -   Everyone is expected to contribute equal *effort*
    -   Everyone is expected to understand *all* code turned in
    -   Individual contribution evaluated by peer evaluation, commits, etc.

## Grading

| Category              | Percentage |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Application Exercises | 5%         |
| Labs                  | 15%        |
| Midterm 1             | 20%        |
| Midterm 2             | 20%        |
| Final                 | 20%        |
| Project               | 20%        |

No specific points allocated to attendance, but the application exercise score is implicitly tied to attendance.

See course syllabus for how the final letter grade will be determined.

## Wiggle room

-   You only have to complete 70% of the AEs to receive full credit;
-   We drop the lowest lab score;
-   We replace the lowest *in-class* midterm score with your final exam score (if it's better).

## Support

-   Help from humans:
    -   Attend office hours
    -   Ask and answer questions on the discussion forum
-   Reserve email for questions on personal matters and/or grades
-   Read the course support page

## Announcements

-   Posted on Canvas (Announcements tool) and sent via email, be sure to check both regularly
-   I'll assume that you've read an announcement by the next "business" day
-   I'll (try my best to) send a weekly update announcement each Friday, outlining the plan for the following week and reminding you what you need to do to prepare, practice, and perform

## Accessibility

-   The [Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu/students) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments.

-   I am committed to making all course materials accessible and I'm always learning how to do this better. If any course component is not accessible to you in any way, please don't hesitate to let me know.

::: callout-note
## If you need testing accommodations

Make sure I get a letter, and make your appointments in the Testing Center now.
:::

## Late work, waivers, lecture recordings, regrades...

-   We have policies!
-   Read about them on the [course syllabus](https://sta199-s25.github.io/syllabus/syllabus_policies.html) and refer back to them when you need it

## Collaboration

-   **Labs**: discussing and helping is fine. Sharing your solutions and copying others is not;

-   **Exams**: collaboration of any kind is completely forbidden on any part of any exam;

-   **Projects**: collaboration of any kind is enthusiastically encouraged *within your team*. Between teams, it's the same as labs; do not directly share your stuff or copy off of others.

## Use of AI tools

-   {{< fa check >}} **AI tools for code:**

    -   Sure, but be careful/critical! Working code `!=` correct/good code.
    -   Must explicitly cite with a direct url linking to the conversation you had.

-   {{< fa ban >}} **AI tools for narrative:** Absolutely not!

-   {{< fa check >}} **AI tools for learning:** Sure, but be careful/critical!

## Academic integrity

> To uphold the Duke Community Standard:
>
> -   I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
>
> -   I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
>
> -   I will act if the Standard is compromised.

-   Zeros from conduct violations will not be dropped or replaced;

-   If people are copying, sharer and recipients penalized equally. It does not matter how well-intentioned everyone was;

-   If we discover violations, they go straight to the conduct office.

## Managing expectations

The stakes are low today. We're just getting our feet wet and working out the kinks:

::: incremental
-   It's the first time all 300+ of us are attempting to access our containers simultaneously. It may choke;

-   If you get stuck on a loading screen of some kind, be patient and let it do its thing. Refreshing, reloading, etc will just amplify our collective problem;

-   If yours never loads, no big deal. Just sit back and watch me, or follow along on a neighbor's screen;

-   Even if yours *does* load, you're welcome to just watch.

# Silly exercise, serious themes

## Statistical lessons

-   **Domain knowledge and modeling assumptions**: data do not speak for themselves. You need some subject-matter expertise about what you're studying, as well as an interpretive lens;
-   Are you asking questions the data can actually answer?
-   Uncertainty has many sources, and in some cases, it may be simply irreducible, no matter how hard you try;
-   **Data quality and data cleaning**: Data are not gospel. There could be noise and mistakes. Then what?
-   **Wisdom of crowds**: aggregating many imperfect guesses can do better than any one individual guess.

## Hard skills

-   GitHub repositories: cloning and pulling;
-   Working with data in CSV format;
-   Rendering a Quarto document to get PDFs that seamlessly integrate written text, code, and output;
-   Using `ggplot` to build up visualizations in layers, like a cake.
