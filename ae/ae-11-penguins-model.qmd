In this application exercise we will be studying penguins.
The data can be found in the **palmerpenguins** package and we will use **tidyverse** and **tidymodels** for data exploration and modeling, respectively.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

Please read the following context and take a `glimpse` at the data set before we get started.

> This data set comprising various measurements of three different penguin species, namely Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap.
> The rigorous study was conducted in the islands of the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.
> These data were collected from 2007 to 2009 by Dr. Kristen Gorman with the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research Program, part of the US Long Term Ecological Research Network.
> The data set is called `penguins`.

Our goal is to understand better how various body measurements and attributes of penguins relate to their body mass.
First, we are going to investigate the relationship between a penguins' flipper lengths and their body masses.

-   Based on our research focus, which variable is the response variable?

Add response here.

-   Visualize the relationship between flipper length and body mass of penguins.

```{r}
#| label: plot-bm-fl
# add code here
```

# Correlation

-   What is correlation?
    What values can correlation take?

Add response here.

-   What is the correlation between flipper length and body mass of penguins?

```{r}
#| label: correlation
# add code here
```

# Defining, fitting, and summarizing a model

-   Write the population model below that explains the relationship between body mass and flipper length.

Add response here.

-   Fit the linear regression model and display the results. Write the estimated model output below.

```{r}
#| label: fit-bm-fl
# add code here
```

Add response here.

-   Interpret the slope and the intercept in the context of the data.

Add response here.

-   Recreate the visualization from above, this time adding a linear regression line to the visualization.

```{r}
#| label: plot-bm-fl-line
# add code here
```

-   What is the estimated body mass for a penguin with a flipper length of 210?

```{r}
#| label: predict-210
# add code here
```

-   What is the estimated body mass for a penguin with a flipper length of 100?

Add response here.

```{r}
#| label: predict-100
# add code here
```

# Another model

-   A different researcher wants to look at body weight of penguins based on the island they were recorded on. How are the variables involved in this analysis different?

Add response here.

-   Make an appropriate visualization to investigate this relationship below. Additionally, calculate the mean body mass by island.

```{r}
#| label: plot-bm-island
# add code here
```

```{r}
#| label: mean-bm-island
# add code here
```

-   Change the geom of your previous plot to `geom_point()`. Use this plot to think about how R models these data.

```{r}
#| label: plot-bm-island-points
# add code here
```

-   Fit the linear regression model and display the results. Write the estimated model output below.

```{r}
#| label: fit-bm-island
# add code here
```

-   Interpret each coefficient in context of the problem.

Add response here.

-   What is the estimated body weight of a penguin on Biscoe island?
    What are the estimated body weights of penguins on Dream and Torgersen islands?

```{r}
#| label: predict-bm-island
# add code here
```
