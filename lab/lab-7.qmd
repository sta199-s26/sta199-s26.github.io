# Introduction

In this lab you'll explore the relationship between distance and air time of flights out of RDU in 2024.

And you'll work in what's considered a pretty unlikely situation: you have access to population data -- all flights out of RDU in 2024!
But we'll ask you to pretend that you didn't actually have access and you need to work with sample data.
How? 
Hang in there, get the population data loaded first, then we'll explain the next steps!

## Getting started

By now you should be familiar with how to get started with a lab assignment by cloning the GitHub repo for the assignment.
If you're not sure how, refer back to an earlier lab.

Open the *lab-7.qmd* template Quarto file and update the `authors` field to add your name first (first and last) and then your teammates' names (first and last).
Render the document.
Examine the rendered document and make sure your and your teammates' names are updated in the document.
Commit and push your changes with a meaningful commit message and push to GitHub.

## Packages

In this lab we will work with the **tidyverse** package.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
```

## Population data

The dataset, called `rdu-flights.csv`, can be found in the `data` folder.

# Questions

## Question 1 - Sample

Take a random sample of 100 flights and store it as `rdu_flights_sample`.
Each person in the class should have a different sample.

## Question 2 - Visualize

Visualize the relationship between `distance` and `air_time` using a scatter plot.
Also add a regression line to the scatter plot.
Do not show the standard error ribbon around the regression line.

How does the relationship between the variables in your sample compare to that of others in your team or others in the class?
How do the regression lines compare?
Exactly the same? Wildly different? Somewhere in between?

## Question 3 - Model and estimate

Fit a model predicting `air_time` using `distance` using the sample data.
Display the model summary.

How does the slope estimate in your sample compare to that of others in your team or others in the class?
Exactly the same? Wildly different? Somewhere in between?

## Question 4 - Quantify(ish) uncertainty

Mark your slope estimate from Question 3 on the number line on the board.
Then, based on the slope estimates from the entire class, determine a reasonable range of values for the estimate of the slope of the relationship between `distance` and `air_time`.
How do you define "reasonable"?

# Wrap-up

::: callout-warning
Before you wrap up the assignment, make sure that you render, commit, and push one final time so that the final versions of both your `.qmd` file and the rendered PDF are pushed to GitHub and your Git pane is empty.
We will be checking these to make sure you have been practicing how to commit and push changes.

## Submission

By now you should also be familiar with how to submit your assignment in Gradescope.

## Grading and feedback

-   This lab is worth 30 points:
    -   10 points for being in lab and turning in *something* -- no partial credit for this part.
    -   20 points for:
        -   answering the questions correctly -- there is partial credit for this part.
        -   following the workflow -- there is partial credit for this part.
-   The workflow points are for:
    -   committing at least three times as you work through your lab,
    -   having your final version of `.qmd` and `.pdf` files in your GitHub repository, and
    -   overall organization.
-   You'll receive feedback on your lab on Gradescope within a week.

Good luck, and have fun with it!
