    "text": "TL;DR: Ask a question you’re curious about and answer it with a dataset of your choice. This is your project in a nutshell.\nMay be too long, but please do read\nThe project for this course will consist of analysis on a dataset of your own choosing. The dataset may already exist, or you may collect your own data using a survey or by conducting an experiment. You can choose the data based on your teams’ interests or based on work in other courses or research projects. The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this course (and beyond, if you like) and apply them to a novel dataset in a meaningful way.\nThe goal is not to do an exhaustive data analysis i.e., do not calculate every statistic and procedure you have learned for every variable, but rather let me know that you are proficient at asking meaningful questions and answering them with results of data analysis, that you are proficient in using R, and that you are proficient at interpreting and presenting the results. Focus on methods that help you begin to answer your research questions. You do not have to apply every statistical procedure we learned. Also, critique your own methods and provide suggestions for improving your analysis. Issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data, and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should be discussed here.\nThe project is very open ended. You should create some kind of compelling visualization(s) of this data in R. There is no limit on what tools or packages you may use but sticking to packages we learned in the course is required. You do not need to visualize all of the data at once. A single high-quality visualization will receive a much higher grade than a large number of poor-quality visualizations. Also pay attention to your presentation. Neatness, coherency, and clarity will count. All analyses must be done in RStudio, using R, and all components of the project must be reproducible (with the exception of the slide deck).\nYou will work on the project with your lab teams.\nThe four milestones for the final project are\n\nMilestone 1 - Working collaboratively\nMilestone 2 - Proposals, with three dataset ideas\nMilestone 3 - Improvement and progress\nMilestone 4 - Peer review, on another team’s project\nMilestone 5 - Presentation with slides and a reproducible project write-up of your analysis, with a draft along the way.\n\nYou will not be submitting anything on Gradescope for the project. Submission of these deliverables will happen on GitHub and feedback will be provided as GitHub issues that you need to engage with and close. The collection of the documents in your GitHub repo will create a webpage for your project. To create the webpage go to the Build tab in RStudio, and click on Render Website."

Student understands how to apply all statistical concepts, can put the results into a cogent argument, can identify weaknesses in the argument, and can clearly communicate the results to others.\n80%-89%: Good effort. Student understands most of the concepts, puts together an adequate argument, identifies some weaknesses of their argument, and communicates most results clearly to others.\n70%-79%: Passing effort. Student has misunderstanding of concepts in several areas, has some trouble putting results together in a cogent argument, and communication of results is sometimes unclear.\n60%-69%: Struggling effort. Student is making some effort, but has misunderstanding of many concepts and is unable to put together a cogent argument.

Just log in to that account to make sure you still remember your username and password. If you are unsure of your login credentials, carefully follow GitHub’s instructions for recovering this information. If you accumulate too many failed login attempts, you will be locked out of your account for the day, which will make it difficult for you to complete the rest of this lab.",

This requires two pieces of information: your name and email address.\nTo do so, you will use the use_git_config() function from the usethis package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou’ll hear about 📦 packages a lot in the context of R – basically they’re how developers write functions and bundle them to distribute to the community (and more on this later too!).\n\n\nType the following lines of code in the console in RStudio filling in your name and the address associated with your GitHub account.\n\nusethis::use_git_config(\n  user.name = \"Your name\", \n  user.email = \"Email associated with your GitHub account\"\n)\n\nFor example, mine would be\n\nusethis::use_git_config(\n  user.name = \"John Zito\", \n  user.email = \"johnczito@gmail.com\"\n)\n\nI used my gmail because that is the one I used to create my GitHub account. You must use the exact same email address that you used to create your GitHub account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I know if I did it right?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you input the usethis::use_git_config(...) command into the console and hit enter/return, it will appear as if nothing happened. To verify that everything worked, you can briefly switch over to the Terminal tab (should be to the right of Console) and type the commands git config user.name and git config user.email. If all is well, these will return whatever text you originally provided. If you notice a mistake or typo, you can just go back to the Console and rerun usethis::use_git_config(...) with modified inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed a recap?

    "text": "5. Baby’s first repo\nA GitHub repository (repo) is a collection of files hosted on GitHub. Repos are the main way we will distribute files to you during the semester. When you copy the files in a repo to your local computing environment (your container, in this case), that’s called “cloning”. So, let’s clone our first repo:\n\nGo to the repository for lab-0 in the course GitHub organization: https://github.com/sta199-s26/lab-0.\n\nClick on the green CODE button, select Use SSH (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, you’ll see the text Clone with SSH). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn RStudio, go to File ➛ New Project ➛Version Control ➛ Git.\nCopy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box Repository URL. Again, please make sure to have SSH highlighted under Clone when you copy the address.\n\nClick Create Project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince this is the first time you are connecting to GitHub from this RStudio instance, you will be asked to confirm the authenticity of the host. This will happen in a pop-up window like the one below. Type yes in the box and hit Enter.\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio will now clone the repo and create a new RStudio project for you. This might take a few seconds. Once done, the files from your GitHub repo will be displayed in the Files pane in RStudio.\n\nYou will need to get used to these steps, because you’ll probably clone at least one new repo every week.",

On individual assignments, you may not directly share work (including code) with another student in this class; on team assignments, you may not directly share work (including code) with another team. “Sharing” includes, but is not limited to, messaging, emailing, or otherwise providing your work to another student or team.\n\nLabs: Collaboration in teams for lab assignments is not only allowed but expected. You will work together with your lab team to complete the lab exercise. However, each student must submit their own write-up of the lab exercise, which should reflect their understanding and ideas. It’s expected that lab submission will be similar across team members.\nProject: Similarly, collaboration within teams is not only allowed but expected for the project. The difference is that the project is a single, collaborative work developed by the entire team. It is the team’s responsibility to make sure all components of the project are vetted and revised by all team members, even if some division of labor takes place for first drafts of components. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed; however, you may not share code or project components across teams.\nHomework: You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write-up with other students. For homework assignments, sharing (or copying) of the code or write-up will be considered a violation for all students involved, regardless of who initiated the sharing.\nExams: You may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams (in class and take home). On exams, collaboration, sharing (or copying) of the code, or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved, regardless of who initiated the sharing.\n\nUse of online resources: I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g., StackOverflow), but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism, resulting in an automatic 0 for the relevant portion of the assignment.\nUse of generative artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, like other online resources. Two guiding principles govern how to use AI in this course:\n\nCognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your thinking ability. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning.\nEthical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and ensure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n\n AI tools for code: You may use generative AI tools when you need help with assignments. However you should first attempt to solve the problem yourself. Your submission should not be a copy-paste of AI-generated content – you must edit the content to ensure it reflects your understanding, has your voice and intellectual input, and conforms with course materials, syntax, terminology, and style. Additionally, the prompt you use cannot be copied and pasted directly from the assignment; you must create a prompt yourself.\n\nYou must also explicitly cite work submitted that is based on AI-generated content. You may use these guidelines to cite AI-generated content. The bare minimum citation must include the AI tool you’re using (e.g., ChatGPT), the model the tool uses, the date when you ran the prompt, and a link to the full transcript of the session starting with your prompt. A new citation must be included for each exercise where you used AI tools, with a new link to the full transceript of the interaction.\n\n AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use AI tools to generate a narrative that you then copy-paste verbatim into an assignment or edit and then insert into your assignment.\n AI tools for learning: You’re welcomed to ask AI tools questions that might help your learning and understanding in this course. However you should be critical of the answers you receive, as AI-generated content may not always be accurate or reliable. Use it to supplement your understanding, not as a substitute for learning.\n\nIn general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content. Identifying AI-generated content is fairly straightforward. Any code identified as AI-generated but not cited as such and any narrative identified as AI-generated will be treated as plagiarism, resulting in an automatic 0 for the relevant portion of the assignment.\n\nIf you are unsure if using a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, please ask a teaching team member.\n\n\nWhat happens if you violate the academic honesty policy?\nAny violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the Duke Community Standard and those specific to this course will automatically results in a zero for the relevant portion or the entire assignment, and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct & Community Standards for further action. Furthermore:\n\nIf a conduct violation results in a zero on a lab or homework, that zero will not be dropped;\nIf a conduct violation results in a zero on a midterm, that zero will not be replaced with your final exam score;\nIf a conduct violation of any kind is discovered on any part of an exam, your final letter grade will be permanently reduced (A- down to B+, B+ down to B, etc);\nIf we discover that students are sharing and copying assignment solutions, all students involved will be penalized equally, the sharer the same as the recipient.",

There are many possible definitions:\n\nAnything you assign!\nPractically speaking, variables are a way for you to store data without having to type it out every time.\nThey allow you to manipulate data with the help of pre-built functions (more on that later).\nThey can also be changed - hence the name “variable”.\n\nWhat are some examples of variables?\n\nThe simplest is a single value - like in math. I could say “x = 10”.\nIt might also be a vector - essentially a list of values. For example, I might just store every name in this class in a vector.\nMost frequently, your variables will be your entire data frames."

This is also possible to do in R:\n\nx = 10\nx\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nHowever, in R, we prefer to use the “&lt;-” operator, to avoid confusion between variable assignment and function arguments.

I clearly told it to select the county column, and it did! So why is it that, when I went to look at the midwest data frame again, it had all of the columns, not just the one that I selected?\nThe answer is that we never saved midwest back to a variable! By default, R will show the output, but not modify the data frame unless I want it to. Let’s look at a couple ways we can do that:\n\nmidwest &lt;- midwest |&gt;\n  select(county)\n\nmidwest\n\n# A tibble: 437 × 1\n   county   \n   &lt;chr&gt;    \n 1 ADAMS    \n 2 ALEXANDER\n 3 BOND     \n 4 BOONE    \n 5 BROWN    \n 6 BUREAU   \n 7 CALHOUN  \n 8 CARROLL  \n 9 CASS     \n10 CHAMPAIGN\n# ℹ 427 more rows\n\n\nThe first option is to simply overwrite the variable. This is useful if you’re never going to need those data in their original form - it saves you some confusion in that case.\nHowever, what if later on I decide I did need those data after all? Perhaps I wanted population density data. I go to try and find this variable in the midwest data set, because that’s where I know it’s stored…\n\nmidwest |&gt;\n  select(popdensity)\n\nError in `select()`:\n! Can't select columns that don't exist.\n✖ Column `popdensity` doesn't exist.\n\n\n…but the variable is gone! This is a common point of confusion for students in STA 199, so it’s important to understand what you’re doing whenever you modify your data in-place like this - you’re overwriting the existing data.\nWe have a couple of options here. If we were loading these data from a .csv file, we could go back to the top of the document. Or, we could do something more effective: Go to Environment, click the little broom icon, and select “yes”.\n\nmidwest\n\n# A tibble: 437 × 28\n     PID county  state  area poptotal popdensity popwhite popblack popamerindian\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n 1   561 ADAMS   IL    0.052    66090      1271.    63917     1702            98\n 2   562 ALEXAN… IL    0.014    10626       759      7054     3496            19\n 3   563 BOND    IL    0.022    14991       681.    14477      429            35\n 4   564 BOONE   IL    0.017    30806      1812.    29344      127            46\n 5   565 BROWN   IL    0.018     5836       324.     5264      547            14\n 6   566 BUREAU  IL    0.05     35688       714.    35157       50            65\n 7   567 CALHOUN IL    0.017     5322       313.     5298        1             8\n 8   568 CARROLL IL    0.027    16805       622.    16519      111            30\n 9   569 CASS    IL    0.024    13437       560.    13384       16             8\n10   570 CHAMPA… IL    0.058   173025      2983.   146506    16559           331\n# ℹ 427 more rows\n# ℹ 19 more variables: popasian &lt;int&gt;, popother &lt;int&gt;, percwhite &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percblack &lt;dbl&gt;, percamerindan &lt;dbl&gt;, percasian &lt;dbl&gt;, percother &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   popadults &lt;int&gt;, perchsd &lt;dbl&gt;, percollege &lt;dbl&gt;, percprof &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   poppovertyknown &lt;int&gt;, percpovertyknown &lt;dbl&gt;, percbelowpoverty &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percchildbelowpovert &lt;dbl&gt;, percadultpoverty &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percelderlypoverty &lt;dbl&gt;, inmetro &lt;int&gt;, category &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nNow the second option: let’s try making the modification a little more carefully: saving the data to a new variable.\n\nmidwest_counties &lt;- midwest |&gt;\n  select(county)\n\nmidwest_counties\n\n# A tibble: 437 × 1\n   county   \n   &lt;chr&gt;    \n 1 ADAMS    \n 2 ALEXANDER\n 3 BOND     \n 4 BOONE    \n 5 BROWN    \n 6 BUREAU   \n 7 CALHOUN  \n 8 CARROLL  \n 9 CASS     \n10 CHAMPAIGN\n# ℹ 427 more rows\n\nmidwest\n\n# A tibble: 437 × 28\n     PID county  state  area poptotal popdensity popwhite popblack popamerindian\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n 1   561 ADAMS   IL    0.052    66090      1271.    63917     1702            98\n 2   562 ALEXAN… IL    0.014    10626       759      7054     3496            19\n 3   563 BOND    IL    0.022    14991       681.    14477      429            35\n 4   564 BOONE   IL    0.017    30806      1812.    29344      127            46\n 5   565 BROWN   IL    0.018     5836       324.     5264      547            14\n 6   566 BUREAU  IL    0.05     35688       714.    35157       50            65\n 7   567 CALHOUN IL    0.017     5322       313.     5298        1             8\n 8   568 CARROLL IL    0.027    16805       622.    16519      111            30\n 9   569 CASS    IL    0.024    13437       560.    13384       16             8\n10   570 CHAMPA… IL    0.058   173025      2983.   146506    16559           331\n# ℹ 427 more rows\n# ℹ 19 more variables: popasian &lt;int&gt;, popother &lt;int&gt;, percwhite &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percblack &lt;dbl&gt;, percamerindan &lt;dbl&gt;, percasian &lt;dbl&gt;, percother &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   popadults &lt;int&gt;, perchsd &lt;dbl&gt;, percollege &lt;dbl&gt;, percprof &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   poppovertyknown &lt;int&gt;, percpovertyknown &lt;dbl&gt;, percbelowpoverty &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percchildbelowpovert &lt;dbl&gt;, percadultpoverty &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percelderlypoverty &lt;dbl&gt;, inmetro &lt;int&gt;, category &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nNow we have two data frames: the new data frame midwest_counties, which contains our modifications from the data pipeline above, and the original data frame midwest, which has not been changed. Both of these are useful operations, and you will undoubtedly use both this semester! However, keep this distinction in mind when you’re mutating your data - don’t remove anything you think you’ll need later."

    "text": "Displaying Variables\nThe first several weeks of this course are dedicated to data cleaning, manipulation, and transformation. As a result, you will often be asked to display the resulting output of your code (and even if we don’t ask you to do this, it’s often a good idea to do so anyway).\nIn the previous section, I mentioned that by default, R will show the output of code but not modify your variables. The opposite is true if you save your changes: R will not display the output of your code.\n\nx &lt;- 10\n\nThere are many ways to display the output of your code in a quarto document. The first, and most common, is simply to write the name of the variable at the bottom of a code chunk:\n\ny &lt;- 30\ny\n\n[1] 30\n\n\nNote: Unlike many languages, R does not require the use of the print() function: While you can still use it, this is a very common artifact of AI-generated code, so if you use it we’re going to look a lot closer at the rest of your responses.\nThis first approach works well for small examples, but may not work as well for data frames:\n\nmidwest\n\n# A tibble: 437 × 28\n     PID county  state  area poptotal popdensity popwhite popblack popamerindian\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n 1   561 ADAMS   IL    0.052    66090      1271.    63917     1702            98\n 2   562 ALEXAN… IL    0.014    10626       759      7054     3496            19\n 3   563 BOND    IL    0.022    14991       681.    14477      429            35\n 4   564 BOONE   IL    0.017    30806      1812.    29344      127            46\n 5   565 BROWN   IL    0.018     5836       324.     5264      547            14\n 6   566 BUREAU  IL    0.05     35688       714.    35157       50            65\n 7   567 CALHOUN IL    0.017     5322       313.     5298        1             8\n 8   568 CARROLL IL    0.027    16805       622.    16519      111            30\n 9   569 CASS    IL    0.024    13437       560.    13384       16             8\n10   570 CHAMPA… IL    0.058   173025      2983.   146506    16559           331\n# ℹ 427 more rows\n# ℹ 19 more variables: popasian &lt;int&gt;, popother &lt;int&gt;, percwhite &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percblack &lt;dbl&gt;, percamerindan &lt;dbl&gt;, percasian &lt;dbl&gt;, percother &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   popadults &lt;int&gt;, perchsd &lt;dbl&gt;, percollege &lt;dbl&gt;, percprof &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   poppovertyknown &lt;int&gt;, percpovertyknown &lt;dbl&gt;, percbelowpoverty &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percchildbelowpovert &lt;dbl&gt;, percadultpoverty &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percelderlypoverty &lt;dbl&gt;, inmetro &lt;int&gt;, category &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nThere are a couple of good workarounds for this!

Note: each column in your data frame is displayed as a row in the glimpse() output. Pay attention to the numbers at the top, and don’t get confused!\nIf you don’t need to display output in your pdf, running view() in the console can actually be very effective! This has the same effect as clicking on the name of a variable in the “Environment” pane in the top-right corner of your R studio. This will open up your data in a new tab, known as the “data viewer”, where you can look through columns, sort by clicking, and even apply filters. Running this in the console means you will be able to view it on your own computer as you work through the problem, but it will not be printed in your final pdf - the best of both worlds.\nIn Lab 1, we used the data viewer to identify outliers in the midwest population density. In the future, you will not be allowed to do this: We expect reproducible code, so you will need to use an assortment of dplyr commands to sort, filter, and select data for display. However, the data viewer can still be useful in a number of situations, so long as you’re careful about it!"

But what exactly is the difference?\nDouble/Numeric\nThe dbl data type, which is the default implementation of the numeric class, stands for double - meaning “double-precision floating-point format”. It’s pretty clear that double is an easier word to remember! This allows you to store numbers with a lot of decimal points (but not infinite!). For example, let’s look at \\(\\pi\\), which is built in as pi in R:\n\npi\n\n[1] 3.141593\n\ntypeof(pi)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\nHere, we use the typeof() function to determine what data type R is using to store our variables. In this case, we can see that R stores pi as a double variable, which is the default for all numeric variables. In general, whenever you work with numbers, they will be doubles, and for purposes of STA 199 there is no issue with this.\nInteger\nThe int data type means integer - as in, the mathematical concept of an integer. All data represented as integers will be whole numbers. This data type is not capable of storing decimal places, so if you try to do decimal operations with it, R will implicitly cast it to another data type. Implicitly means that it does this without us telling it to. Let’s take a look at a couple of examples:\n\na &lt;- 3\ntypeof(a)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\nBy default, R will treat all numbers as the numeric class. If you want to explicitly tell R that your number is an integer, follow the number with “L”:\n\na &lt;- 3L\ntypeof(a)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n\nNow, let’s say we want to divide this number by 2:\n\nb &lt;- a / 2\ntypeof(b)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\nSince 3 is not divisible by 2, the output is a decimal. However, since we have performed a decimal operation, rather than trying to guess whether to round up or down, R simply implicitly casts it back to numeric.\nLogical/Boolean\nWhile there isn’t an example in this data frame, there is a data type called logical - which represents true/false.\n\nc &lt;- TRUE\ntypeof(c)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\nIn R, you need to type out TRUE/FALSE in all caps for it to be recognized. Under the hood, R stores these values as “FALSE = 0” and “TRUE = 1”, which means that if you want to find the percentage of TRUE in your data, you can just take the average:\n\nd &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)\nmean(d)\n\n[1] 0.6666667\n\n\nCharacter/String\nThe character data type represents all characters and strings in R. Unlike some languages, R does not differentiate between these. In general, strings are used to represent words and categorical data, for example:\n\nplace &lt;- \"Durham, NC\"\ntypeof(place)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nIn order for R to recognize a variable as a string, it needs to be wrapped in quotation marks. Single or double quotation marks are acceptable:\n\nnew_place &lt;- 'Cincinnati'\ntypeof(new_place)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nHowever, missing quotation marks will generate an error:\n\nanother_place &lt;- Timbuktu\n\nError: object 'Timbuktu' not found\n\n\nIn this case, since Timbuktu is not wrapped in quotation marks, R is looking for a pre-existing object - a variable or a function - called Timbuktu. Since no such object exists, R throws an error, and will refuse to compile your document (unless you force it to).\nThere is another important point of caution here. Sometimes, when you load in a data frame, there will be columns that should be represented as numbers, but are accidentally represented as strings. If you’re not careful, this can have consequences. For example, consider the following:\n\n0 == 00\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\"0\" == \"00\"\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nIn R, the numbers 0 and 00 represent the same thing! However, when they are strings, they do not. R treats numbers differently than it does strings, so it’s important to pay attention to which one you are actually implementing. You might also run into issues with some of your operations - for example, if you try to take the average of a column of strings, R has no idea what to do and will throw an error.\nNote: pay attention to the usage of two equal signs here, rather than just one. Why did we do this? (More on this shortly.)"

    "section": "Casting",
    "text": "Casting\nSo what is the solution to this problem? The answer is called casting, which means changing the data type. You do this using the as.character(), as.numeric(), and as.logical() commands. Let’s look at an example:\n\ne &lt;- \"00\"\ntypeof(e)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\ne\n\n[1] \"00\"\n\ne &lt;- as.numeric(e)\ntypeof(e)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\ne\n\n[1] 0\n\ne &lt;- as.logical(e)\ntypeof(e)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\ne\n\n[1] FALSE\n\ne &lt;- as.character(e)\ntypeof(e)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\ne\n\n[1] \"FALSE\"\n\ne &lt;- as.numeric(e) # What happened?\n\nWarning: NAs introduced by coercion\n\ne\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nBe mindful with your casting - you can lose information along the way!\nNote: NA is a specific type in R. It essentially means “nothing” or “there was an error”. You cannot use == to check whether a value is NA. Instead, you must use is.na(). Similarly, you may come across NULL, which essentially means “this memory has not been declared”. To check for NULL, you must use is.null()."

    "text": "Equals\nThe first Boolean operator is “equals”. This is a place where it is easy to get confused. We use the single equals sign, =, to denote assignment - essentially, telling R “this thing takes this value.” We use the double equals sign, ==, to denote comparison - essentially, asking R “are these two values equal?” It is important to keep these two things distinct - if you want to check equality, or filter for a specific value, you always need to use the double equals sign!\n\nmidwest |&gt;\n  filter(county = \"Cook\")\n\nError in `filter()`:\n! We detected a named input.\nℹ This usually means that you've used `=` instead of `==`.\nℹ Did you mean `county == \"Cook\"`?\n\n\nHere’s an example of where a single equals sign is incorrect, and R returns an error. Fortunately, it has a very helpful suggestion in the error message! Let’s replace that with the double equals:\n\nmidwest |&gt;\n  filter(county == \"Cook\")\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 28\n# ℹ 28 variables: PID &lt;int&gt;, county &lt;chr&gt;, state &lt;chr&gt;, area &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   poptotal &lt;int&gt;, popdensity &lt;dbl&gt;, popwhite &lt;int&gt;, popblack &lt;int&gt;,\n#   popamerindian &lt;int&gt;, popasian &lt;int&gt;, popother &lt;int&gt;, percwhite &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percblack &lt;dbl&gt;, percamerindan &lt;dbl&gt;, percasian &lt;dbl&gt;, percother &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   popadults &lt;int&gt;, perchsd &lt;dbl&gt;, percollege &lt;dbl&gt;, percprof &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   poppovertyknown &lt;int&gt;, percpovertyknown &lt;dbl&gt;, percbelowpoverty &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percchildbelowpovert &lt;dbl&gt;, percadultpoverty &lt;dbl&gt;, …\n\n\nNow there’s no error message, but we also didn’t return any values. Why did this happen? When I use ==, I am checking whether these two strings are exactly equivalent, and that includes being case sensitive. If I view the data in the data frame, I see that all of the county names are actually in all caps. I can fix the string in my example…\n\nmidwest |&gt;\n  filter(county == \"COOK\")\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 28\n    PID county state  area poptotal popdensity popwhite popblack popamerindian\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n1   576 COOK   IL    0.058  5105067     88018.  3204947  1317147         10289\n# ℹ 19 more variables: popasian &lt;int&gt;, popother &lt;int&gt;, percwhite &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percblack &lt;dbl&gt;, percamerindan &lt;dbl&gt;, percasian &lt;dbl&gt;, percother &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   popadults &lt;int&gt;, perchsd &lt;dbl&gt;, percollege &lt;dbl&gt;, percprof &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   poppovertyknown &lt;int&gt;, percpovertyknown &lt;dbl&gt;, percbelowpoverty &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percchildbelowpovert &lt;dbl&gt;, percadultpoverty &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   percelderlypoverty &lt;dbl&gt;, inmetro &lt;int&gt;, category &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\n…and finally find Chicago!"

We will not look at any examples here, because they can get very confusing, very quickly (and are generally unnecessary for this course). However, if you do want to combine Boolean operators, here are some things to keep in mind:\n\nParentheses: Just like in math, any statements that you put in parentheses will execute first. If I say “A and B or C”, it’s unclear exactly what I mean. If I would accept either (A and B) or (A and C), I would write A & (B | C), meaning I need at least one of B or C to be true. If I would accept either (A and B) or C, I would write (A & B) | C, meaning I need either (A and B) or C to be true.\nOrder of operations: Pay attention to the order in which your statements evaluate! If I write !(A & B), that means I need at least one of A or B to be false. If I write !A & !B, that means I need both A and B to be false. This can get confusing, so it’s best to write out your logic fully and work through a few examples by hand (or avoid layering these operators entirely)."

A function will always have a name, followed by open and closed parentheses (). Some functions do not take arguments. However, if they do, these arguments will go within the parentheses. Once R sees an opening parenthesis, it will not execute the code until it sees a closing parenthesis. Beware - when you start layering functions, such as using aes() inside of ggplot(), you need to pay attention to what your parentheses are around and make sure that they all close!"

    "section": "Arguments",
    "text": "Arguments\nArguments are the commands that you give to a function that tell it what to do. Most functions take at least one argument, and some can take arbitrarily many. Functions have a default order for (some of) their arguments. If you know this order, you do not have to explicitly name the arguments. If not, you must list them explicitly. Here are two examples:\n\n# Named Arguments\nggplot(\n  data = midwest, \n  mapping = aes(x = poptotal, y = popdensity, color = percwhite)\n  ) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Unnamed Arguments\nggplot(\n  midwest, \n  aes(poptotal, popdensity, percwhite)\n  ) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn ggplot, the first two arguments are always data and mapping, so it is common to drop these. However, in the second plot here, we lost our fill aesthetic. Why?\nWhen we look at the aes() documentation, we see that x is the first named argument and y is the second, but after that there are no named arguments. That means, while you can add more aesthetics, you must name them explicitly, since they do not appear by default.\nArguments Requiring Quotes\nIn R, you will sometimes need to pass a function an argument that is from a list of options. In this case, you need to wrap it in quotation marks (can anyone tell me why?) Let’s take a look at the following function, and try to identify arguments with and without quotes:\n\nggplot(midwest, aes(\n                    x = state,\n                    y = poptotal,\n                    fill = county\n                  )) +\n  geom_col(position = \"stack\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") # STA 199 students are not allowed to do this\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, we can pass in x = state, y = poptotal, and fill = county without quotation marks, because R knows we are referencing columns in a data frame, which are actual objects in our environment. However, we pass in position = \"stack\" with quotation marks. To see why, let’s look at what happens when we drop our quotes:\n\nggplot(midwest, aes(\n                    x = state,\n                    y = poptotal,\n                    fill = county\n                  )) +\n  geom_col(position = stack) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") # STA 199 students are not allowed to do this\n\nError in `check_subclass()`:\n! `x` must be either a string or a &lt;Position&gt; object, not a function.\n\n\nThe argument for position is looking for either a string or a &lt;Position&gt; object. Since we don’t know what &lt;Position&gt; objects are, it’s clear that we should be giving it a string. R needs to find this argument in a list: we could say position = \"dodge\" or position = \"fill\", so long as we include quotation marks, since those are on the list of accepted arguments.\n\nggplot(midwest, aes(\n                    x = state,\n                    y = poptotal,\n                    fill = county\n                  )) +\n  geom_col(position = \"fill\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") # STA 199 students are not allowed to do this\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPipe Operator\nMany times in this class, you will see the symbol |&gt; used. This is known as the pipe operator, and it allows us to have a so-called “data pipeline”. This helps make code a lot more readable! Let’s take a look at why:\n\nhead(arrange(mutate(select(filter(midwest, state == \"IL\"), county, state, area, poptotal, inmetro), inmetro = as.logical(inmetro)), desc(poptotal)), 10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\n   county    state  area poptotal inmetro\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;  \n 1 COOK      IL    0.058  5105067 TRUE   \n 2 DU PAGE   IL    0.02    781666 TRUE   \n 3 LAKE      IL    0.028   516418 TRUE   \n 4 WILL      IL    0.05    357313 TRUE   \n 5 KANE      IL    0.029   317471 TRUE   \n 6 ST CLAIR  IL    0.04    262852 TRUE   \n 7 Winnebago IL    0.03    252913 TRUE   \n 8 MADISON   IL    0.045   249238 TRUE   \n 9 MCHENRY   IL    0.036   183241 TRUE   \n10 PEORIA    IL    0.038   182827 TRUE   \n\n\nTechnically, we can write our code in this manner! Strictly speaking, under the hood, the pipe operator is reconstructing your code into this format. However, this is nearly impossible to read (I’ve been coding in R for years, and I still ran into multiple errors trying to write this).\nWith the pipe operator, we can skip this and execute each function on its own line. Every pipeline starts with a data frame or equivalent object, so that R knows what we are operating on. By default, the pipe operator “pipes” your data into the first argument of a function - which, in the tidyverse, is almost always the “data” argument. This lets us write our data in a much neater pipeline, where you can see step-by-step what is happening to the data:\n\nmidwest |&gt;   # Operate on the midwest data frame\n  filter(state == \"IL\") |&gt;   # Filter for only the counties in Illinois\n  select(county, state, area, poptotal, inmetro) |&gt;   # Select only these five columns, and drop all others\n  mutate(inmetro = as.logical(inmetro)) |&gt;   # Cast inmetro to a logical type\n  arrange(desc(poptotal)) |&gt;   # Arrange the data frame by poptotal in descending order\n  head(10)   # Select the top 10 rows\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\n   county    state  area poptotal inmetro\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;  \n 1 COOK      IL    0.058  5105067 TRUE   \n 2 DU PAGE   IL    0.02    781666 TRUE   \n 3 LAKE      IL    0.028   516418 TRUE   \n 4 WILL      IL    0.05    357313 TRUE   \n 5 KANE      IL    0.029   317471 TRUE   \n 6 ST CLAIR  IL    0.04    262852 TRUE   \n 7 Winnebago IL    0.03    252913 TRUE   \n 8 MADISON   IL    0.045   249238 TRUE   \n 9 MCHENRY   IL    0.036   183241 TRUE   \n10 PEORIA    IL    0.038   182827 TRUE   \n\n\nMuch better, right? Remember, whenever you’re using the pipe operator (or the +, in ggplot, which is different!), you should start a new line of code. As long as you have a pipe operator, R is expecting another function, so it won’t execute only part of your code.\nNote: In this class, we focus on the base R pipe, which is denoted by |&gt;. However, when you’re debugging on the internet, you may come across the symbol %&gt;%, which is the magrittr pipe. There are some technical differences in these that generally go beyond the scope of this class, but they essentially serve the same purpose. Don’t be scared by the magrittr pipe when you’re doing your debugging!"

This forces you to write reproducible code, and it’s the first thing to think about when you run into errors while rendering!\nAside: LaTeX\nWhen you click “Render”, if you are rendering to a .pdf file, R uses a tool called LaTeX to pull all of your code together. LaTeX is a very cool program, which allows you to input all sorts of things: Greek letters, formatted exponents, etc. If you want to insert such things, place code between dollar signs: For example, to write the Greek letter \\(\\gamma\\), you would input $\\gamma$ in your quarto document.

There are a lot of possible errors with geom_bar(), and it would take too long to look through them all to get to your specific problem!\n“Problem while computing stat.”: This is more helpful, because it gives a little more direction as to the source of the error, but it is still too general - what stat are we computing? What problem?\n“Error occured in the 1st layer”: This can be helpful for you, if you know the order of ggplot layers. However, it is probably not helpful to google, since people could have built their layers in a different order before encountering this error.\n“Caused by error in setup_params()”: Closer! This is getting more and more specific, and this might be good enough to google. However, it still doesn’t say what the error is, it just says that there was one.\n“stat_count() must only have an x or y aesthetic”: Bingo! This is the one we’re looking for, which tells us exactly what the issue is. Now, it may be possible to interpret manually, but let’s say you can’t. Here’s where we go now:\n\nI would copy-paste the entire final line into google. You don’t want to copy-paste the full error message, since that’s probably too specific, and you might not find any results. At the same time, you don’t want to copy-paste only a couple of words, since that might not be specific enough, and you could be stuck looking through a lot of links. If you google just that line, you are likely to find someone on stack exchange who has posted a question with this exact (or almost this exact) error message. You can also help your google out by throwing in some relevant key words:\n\nggplot\nR\nerror\n\nTake a couple minutes to google this, and see if you can figure out what’s wrong with the code! Then, remember to cite the source where you found this answer! In general, it’s okay to google your error messages for help, but not to use someone else’s solution without credit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s wrong with this code?\n\n\n\n\n\nI looked at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61068031/error-stat-count-can-only-have-an-x-or-y-aesthetic for my answer. There’s a few different suggestions on this page, all of which could be useful! This page definitely suggests to me that the issue with my plot is in the geom_bar() line - which makes sense, since this is layer 1 of the plot. While they have a couple simple fixes, here’s the actual error I wrote: geom_bar() is expecting only one variable. If you want two variables, like this, you should use geom_col() instead."
